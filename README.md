# Lab 03: Extend your 'About Me' and guessing game

 Driver: Luke Chandler
 Navigator: Levi Porter 

Levi was already using functions so what we did together was just tweak some of the logic and fix some bugs.

## Lab 04: Notes for assignment
- No functions in javascript.
- Use `prompt` and `alert` for user input and responses.
- Use at least 1 `<ul>` and `<ol>`.
- Convert biographical elements in unordered list.
- Add a "Top Ten List" to the page.
- Add 6th question prompting user to guess a number:
  - Tell them if their guess is low or high.
  - User gets 4 attempts.
- Add 7th question w/ multiple possible answers:
  - Store answers in array.
  - User gets 6 attempts.
  - Upon correct answer or max attempts, display all possible answers to user.
- Tell the user how many they got correct out of the 7 questions.

## Idea
1. Land on page.
2. Prompted with a question (start the game).
3. Prompts
4. Show questions and responses.
5. Display message about getting all correct.
6. Show top ten list.
